DogPro Service Layers

DogPro Web Application

Short Project Description
DogPro is a comprehensive web application designed to simplify and manage all aspects of dog care. It provides a user-friendly interface where dog owners can create, update, and manage pet profiles.

Overview
The DogPro web application provides a back-end service layer for our Dog Profile Management system. It handles the communication with the database, takes care of data storage and retrieval, and provides data to the front-end User Interface (UI) as needed. 

How It Works
The service layer of DogPro accepts requests from the UI, processes these requests, communicates with the database, and returns the appropriate responses to the UI. This allows the application to manage various dog profiles and track schedules and training plans efficiently.

Design Documents
All relevant design documents related to the service layer are in the `design` folder. This includes details of how the service layer communicates with the database, alongside the database design documents, which illustrate how the data is structured and stored.

Set Up
- Step 1: Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Step 2: Install the necessary dependencies in the `package.json` file using `npm install`.
- Step 3: Set up your database and connect it to the application by updating the database connection string in the application configuration file.

Usage
- Start the application by running `npm start` in your terminal.
- Navigate to the specified port on your localhost to interact with the application.
- Utilize the user interface to create, update, and manage dog profiles.
- Use the UI to update and track feeding and potty schedules and training plans.
